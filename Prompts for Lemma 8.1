Please formalize the partial proof of the following theorem in Lean 4 by replacing the "sorry" : 
theorem lemma81 (M N : ℕ) (hMN : 0 < M ∧ M < N) (A : ℕ) (hA : 1 ≤ A)
  (a : Fin M → Fin N → ℤ) (ha : ∀ j k, |a j k| ≤ A) :
  ∃ x : Fin N → ℤ, (∃ k, x k ≠ 0)
  ∧ ∀ j, ∑ k, a j k * x k = 0
  ∧ ∀ k, |x k| ≤ (N * A)^(M / (N - M)) := sorry
\begin{proof}
    
Let 

\begin{equation}
H = (N  A) ^ {\frac{M}{N-M})}.
\end{equation}

Then 
\begin{equation}
NA < (H+1)^ {(\frac{N-M}{M})}.
\end{equation}

Hence
\begin{equation}
(NAH) + 1 \leq  NA(H + 1)
\end{equation}

and 
\begin{equation}
 NA(H + 1) < (H + 1)^\frac{N}{M}
\end{equation}

Define 
\begin{equation}
y_j=a_{j1}x_1 + \cdots a_{jN}x_N, \mbox{ } 1\leq j\leq M.
\end{equation}

We define $B_j$ as the sum of the $- min (0, a_{jk})$ for all $a_{jk}.$

Similarly, we define $C_j$ as the sum of the $max (0, a_{jk})$ for all $a_{jk}.$

\end{proof}

Here is a formalization of the given partial proof in Lean 4. Note that the proof is still incomplete as the "sorry" statements are placeholders for proofs that have yet to be filled in.

  let C : Fin M → ℕ
  | j => ∑ k : Fin N, max 0 (a j k)

  -- The rest of the proof is still incomplete
  sorry
end
```

This formalization follows the structure of the given proof, defining the necessary variables and stating the intermediate results. However, the actual proofs of these results are left as "sorry" statements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an example of the correct syntax for "let" statements : "  let y : Fin M → ℤ
  | j => ∑ k : Fin N, a j k * x k
" should change to "  let y : Fin M → ℤ := fun j => ∑ k : Fin N, a j k * x k. Do the same for "C" and "B".

Thank you for pointing that out. Here is the corrected version with the suggested changes:

In this version, the "let" statements for "y", "B", and "C" have been updated to use the correct syntax, with the right-hand side of the assignment defined using "fun" to specify the function's input and output.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, so now the types of B and C are incorrect because (a : Fin M → Fin N → ℤ) so B and C should be of type "Fin M → ℤ".



You are correct. Here is the updated version with the correct types for "B" and "C":

end
```

In this version, the types of "B" and "C" have been updated to "Fin M → ℤ" to match the type of "a". The definitions of "B" and "C" have also been updated to use "min" and "max" correctly with the type "ℤ".


-----------------------------------------------
OK, let's continue with the rest of the proof. For any set of integers $(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ satisfying

\begin{equation}
0\leq x_k \leq H, \mbox{ }1\leq k \leq N.
\end{equation}

we have that 

\begin{equation}
-{B_j}H \leq y_j \leq {C_j}H,
\end{equation} 

and 

\begin{equation}
B_j +C_j \leq NA.
\end{equation}

Here is the updated proof with the new information:

    have hBC : B j + C j ≤ N * A := sorry
    exact ⟨hYL, hYR, hBC⟩
  end

  -- The rest of the proof is still incomplete
  sorry
end
```

In this version, I added a new statement `hYBound` to formalize the given bounds for `y_j`, `B_j`, and `C_j`. 
The statement uses universal quantifiers to express that the bounds hold for any set of integers `x_k` satisfying the given conditions.
The proof of `hYBound` is left as "sorry" for now.
--------------------------------------------------

Now, continue : The number of sets of $(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ satisfying 

\begin{equation}
0\leq x_k \leq H, \mbox{ }1\leq k \leq N.
\end{equation}

is $(H + 1)^N.$ 

And the corresponding number of set of sets 
$(y_1, \ldots, y_M)$ is at most $$(NAH + 1)^M.$$

It follows from the fact 

\begin{equation}
(NAH) + 1 \leq  NA(H + 1) < (H + 1)^\frac{N}{M}
\end{equation}

and the pigeonhole principle that there must be two sets $(x'_1, \ldots, x'_N)$ and $(x''_1, \ldots, x''_N)$ which correspond to the same set $(y_1, \ldots, y_M)$. 

Let $ x_k = x'_k - x''_k,$$ (1 \leq k \leq N) $ so that $(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ is now the required set satisfying

\begin{equation}
a_{j1}x_1 + \cdots a_{jN}x_N = 0, \mbox { } 1\leq j \leq M
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
|x_k| \leq(NA)^{\frac{M}{N-M}}, 1\leq k \leq N.
\end{equation}

\end{proof}

* `hYCount` formalizes the fact that the number of corresponding sets of `y_j` is at most `(NAH + 1)^M`.
* `hPigeonhole` applies the pigeonhole principle to find two sets of `x_k` that correspond to the same set of `y_j`.
* `hX` proves that the difference between the two sets of `x_k` satisfies the required conditions.

The proofs of these statements are left as "sorry" for now. Finally, the proof is completed by existential introduction, introducing the required set `x` and the proof that it satisfies the required conditions.

The notation for the cardinalities of X and Y are Finset.card X.toFinset and Finset.card Y.toFinset respectively and you need the instances Fintype X and Fintype Y.

You're right, I apologize for the oversight. Here's the updated version with the correct notation for the cardinalities of `X` and `Y` and the necessary instances of `Fintype`:

In this version, I've added the necessary instances of `Fintype` for `X` and `Y`, and used `Finset.card X.toFinset` and `Finset.card Y.toFinset` to denote the cardinalities of `X` and `Y`.
---------------------

In fact "∃ x' x'' ∈ X" is not a valid syntax. What you want to say is that x' and  x'' are of type Fin N -> Z

In this version, I've corrected the syntax for `hPigeonhole` to state that `x'` and `x''` are of type `Fin N → ℤ`.

In this version, I've added a new statement `hCardXY` to prove that the cardinality of `X` is larger than the cardinality of `Y`. This statement is used to apply the pigeonhole principle.

you haven't declared x' and x'' before using them for "let x : Fin N → ℤ := fun k => x' k - x'' k"



You're right, I apologize for the mistake. Here's the corrected version:

In this version, I've replaced `obtain` with `rcases` and included the last statements needed to complete the proof. 
The proof of `hX` is broken down into three parts: proving that there exists `k` such that `x_k ≠ 0`, 
proving that for all `j`, the sum of `a_jk * x_k` is 0, and proving that for all `k`, the absolute value of `x_k`
is less than or equal to `(N * A)^(M / (N - M))`. These three statements are then combined to complete the proof of `hX`.

In this version, I've removed the `rfl` from the `rcases` statement and replaced `begin` with `by` and removed the `end`.
--------------------------

Replace  "have hXNonzero : ∃ k, x k ≠ 0 := by sorry
  have hXSumZero : ∀ j, ∑ k, a j k * x k = 0 := by sorry
  have hXAbsBound : ∀ k, |x k| ≤ (N * A)^(M / (N - M)) := by sorry " with "  have hX : (∃ k, x k ≠ 0) ∧ ∀ (j : Fin M), ∑ k : Fin N, a j k * x k = 0 ∧ ∀ (k : Fin N), |x k| ≤ (↑N * ↑A) ^ (M / (N - M)) := sorry
" and complete the proof. also please replace the "begin" with "by"

In this version, I've replaced the three separate `have` statements with a single `have` statement that combines the three conditions using `∧`. I've also replaced the `begin` with `by`.
